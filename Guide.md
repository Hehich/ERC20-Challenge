# Guide

Let's get you equipped! This guide will go over setting up your development environment and ERC20 token functionality.

## Foundry

Starting point is setting up a new Foundry project to deploy our contract to Scroll Sepolia Testnet and verify it.

If you need help regarding with Foundry, please see: [Level Up: Build with Foundry](https://www.levelup.xyz/content/level-up-foundry).

## ERC20

First of all, notice that ERC20 tokens are fungible. So each of an individual ERC20 token is completely indistinguishable than the other. For example, technically there is no difference between a USDT in my wallet and the one in yours.

// Define your ERC20 token contract
contract MyToken is ERC20 {

    // Constructor that mints the initial supply to the deployer of the contract
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        // Mint the initial supply of tokens to the deployer's address
    }

    // Function to mint new tokens to a specified address
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        // Implement the mint function using the _mint internal function
    }

    // Function to burn tokens from a specified address
    function burn(address from, uint256 amount) public {
        // Implement the burn function using the _burn internal function
    }

    // Function to transfer tokens from the caller's address to a specified address
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        // Implement the transfer function using the _transfer internal function
    }

    // Function to approve an address to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the caller
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        // Implement the approve function using the _approve internal function
    }

    // Function to transfer tokens from one address to another using an allowance
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        // Implement the transferFrom function using the _transfer and _approve internal functions
    }
}
```

### What you need?

1. **Total Supply:** You should initialize the total supply of your token.
2. **Balances:** You should store a balance value for each user.
3. **Allowance:** Similarly, you should store an allowance value for each user. It will determine how much allowance each user gives to different accounts.
4. **Name, Symbol and Decimals:** Of course your token needs a fancy name, a symbol, and number of decimals to help EVM understand the units.
5. **Transfer Function:** You should write a transfer function allowing users move their assets (in terms of your token) to another addresses.
6. **Approve Function:** You'll need an approve function to manage allowances.
7. **A More Generic Transfer Function:** Build another transfer function so that a caller can even decide who is sending the transferring tokens.
8. **Mint and Burn Functions:** Finally you will need minting and burning functions to increase or decrease the total supply of your token.
